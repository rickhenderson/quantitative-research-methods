# Correlation
From Reading Research and Statistics by Shuyler Huck, Second Edition

## Types of Correlation
* Pearson's Correlation (r)
     * used when two variables are quantitative raw scores
* Spearman's rank-order correlation (r sub s)
      * Used when 2 variables are ranks instead of rzw scores
* Kendall's tau (t)
      * Possibly superior to Spearman's correlation because it has the ability to deal with ties

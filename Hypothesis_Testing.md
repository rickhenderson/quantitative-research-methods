# Types of Variables

N O I R
## Nominal
* Bystander = 1
* Bully = 2
* Victim = 3

## Ordinal
* High status bully = 1 
* Med status bully = 2
* Low status bully = 3

## Interval Variable
* The width matters
* There is no true zero

## Ratio variable
* Has a true zero - Never bullied means something

## More types of variables
* independent, predictor, or treatement
* outcome or dependent
* mediator (intervening) variables: they explain the relationship betweeen the DV and IV (knoweldge gained)
* moderator (effect): influences the strength of relationship between the IV and a DV
* control variables
* confounding variables: researchers don't or can't be measured and might influence the outcomes

* regression analysis can help determine if there are relationships between the variable, and later calculations help remove it's influence from the equations

## From Theory to Variable and Back Again
Theories:
* suggest
* predict relations
* predict impact
* lead to revisions

# Key Elements of Hypothese
* predictions about the relationships among variables
* based on prior research
* a testable statement

```
In our paper - identify the hypotheses and judge them.
```

# Review of Statistical Analysis
* descriptive (univariate analysis)
* associational (bivariate and multivariate)
* Inferential - for making estimates about populations and for **significance and hypothesis testing**

**If your study is about associational variables, there won't probably be a hypothesis in the introduction.**

```
Correlations are interesting, but not as interesting as **predictors**.
```

# Different Types of Designs
* Experimental
* Quasi-experimental
* Non-experimental
(table activity)

---
*Experimental:* identifies variables and takes measurements, random sampling, double-blind, determine correlations

*Quasi-experimental:* relies on research, don't do random sampling, they assign subjects to treatment groups; at least one IV is not manipulated; moderate causal inferences
ie. Measure growth of a plant based on water intake

*Non-experimental:* Observation; IV not manipulated; not assigned to conditions; weak weak causal inferences
ie. Observing children in a school yard to report on behaviour

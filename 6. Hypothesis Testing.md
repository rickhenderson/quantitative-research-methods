# Types of Variables

N O I R
## Nominal
* Bystander = 1
* Bully = 2
* Victim = 3

## Ordinal
* High status bully = 1 
* Med status bully = 2
* Low status bully = 3

## Interval Variable
* The width matters
* There is no true zero

## Ratio variable
* Has a true zero - Never bullied means something

## More types of variables
* independent, predictor, or treatement
* outcome or dependent
* mediator (intervening) variables: they explain the relationship betweeen the DV and IV (knoweldge gained)
* moderator (effect): influences the strength of relationship between the IV and a DV
* control variables
* confounding variables: researchers don't or can't be measured and might influence the outcomes

* regression analysis can help determine if there are relationships between the variable, and later calculations help remove it's influence from the equations

## From Theory to Variable and Back Again
Theories:
* suggest
* predict relations
* predict impact
* lead to revisions

# Key Elements of Hypothese
* predictions about the relationships among variables
* based on prior research
* a testable statement

```
In our paper - identify the hypotheses and judge them.
```

# Review of Statistical Analysis
* descriptive (univariate analysis)
* associational (bivariate and multivariate)
* Inferential - for making estimates about populations and for **significance and hypothesis testing**

**If your study is about associational variables, there won't probably be a hypothesis in the introduction.**

```
Correlations are interesting, but not as interesting as **predictors**.
```

# Different Types of Designs
* Experimental
* Quasi-experimental
* Non-experimental

(table activity)

---
**Experimental:** identifies variables and takes measurements, **random sampling**, double-blind, determine correlations
ie. Strict greenhouse lab environment, no rain, dew, shade factors; precise amount of water controlled

**Quasi-experimental:** **pre-existing groups**; relies on research, don't do random sampling, they assign subjects to treatment groups; at least one IV is not manipulated; moderate causal inferences
ie. Measure growth of a plant based on water intake; use the same plant; not the same level of control

**Non-experimental:** **Observation**; IV not manipulated; not assigned to conditions; weak weak causal inferences
ie. Observing children in a school yard to report on behaviour; 
ie. measuring plant growth and checking weather history

Caffiene effects student results on test. Has a control and a treatment group.
Experimental: Random sampling

Quasi-experimental: **pre-existing groups**, classrooms, not controlling how often, how much, researcher does not decide, still looking at grades
Non-experimental: observing without knowing who had coffee

Pregnancy: Effects of smoking on birthweight
Experiment: Random sampling; Pack of smokes per day
Quasi-experimental: Just find smokers and non-smokers; could be confounding variables; more associated variables; 
Non-experimental: observe, ask questions

```
In our papers, identify the type of design.
```

**At the start of an experiment, it is important to establish that the control group and experimental groups have similar baselines, ie., pre-test reading ability of different groups before the experiment. Similar age, similar SES etc.**

Ethical sent or volunteers will always affect the validity of results.

* Do any or all of your studies involve random assignment of subjects?
* Do any or all of your studies involve a control group?

## The Independent Variable
Best: researcher controls it
* Did anyone have a study in which the researcher had control over the IV?
* Did anyone have a study in which the researcher had limited control over the IV?


# The Null Hypothesis - H<sub>o</sub>
Use of a log sheet has no result on reading results.
The hypothesis of no result.

**The Alternative Hypothesis - H<sub>1</sub>**
* may be directional or non-directional
** **non=directional**: control group and experimental group are different but say nothing about how
** **directional**: state how the groups will be different
* Always determine prior to data collection

See chart for Decision making regarding the Null Hypothesis.

Reject: p < 0.05

Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis: (not prove anything, we establish evidence for).

Key findings of reading experiment... but is that difference meaningful? Maybe the results are simply due to sampling error...

* p = probability (standard cut off is 0.05 or 5%)
* More accurate: A result of this size would occur by chance alone, 5% of the time.
* **MOST ACCURATE:** If there was **NO difference** in the population, the probablilty one (a difference) of finding of this size or bigger in a random sample of the same size would be 5%. (Ie, the chance of finding a differnece in mean reading scores of this size or bigger in arandome sample of the same size would be 5%).

```
If p > 0.05, we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis, so our findings are not valid.
```

## Significance
Statistically significant vs. practically significant

Gender score difference of 3.14 vs 3.11: Would you spend $1M?
Gender score difference of 3.7 vs 2.1? Would you spend $1M? (scores out of 4)

**Now, on to practical significance:**

* Significance tests (p values or Type 1 errors)
* Effect sizes (Cohen's d, Pearson's r, Odds ratio)
* Confidence intervals
* Power (Type II errors)

Type I Error:
* We rejected a true Null Hypothesis (false positive)
* p-value is the probabiity of making a Type I Error.

Type II Error:
* Accept a false Null Hypothesis (false negative)
* Power is the probability of avoiding a Type II Error.

```
In life threatening situations, researchers should reduce acceptable p-value (alpha) to 0.01.
```

ie. gifted children

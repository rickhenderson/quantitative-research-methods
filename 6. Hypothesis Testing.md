# Types of Variables

N O I R
## Nominal
* Bystander = 1
* Bully = 2
* Victim = 3

## Ordinal
* High status bully = 1 
* Med status bully = 2
* Low status bully = 3

## Interval Variable
* The width matters
* There is no true zero

## Ratio variable
* Has a true zero - Never bullied means something

## More types of variables
* independent, predictor, or treatement
* outcome or dependent
* mediator (intervening) variables: they explain the relationship betweeen the DV and IV (knoweldge gained)
* moderator (effect): influences the strength of relationship between the IV and a DV
* control variables
* confounding variables: researchers don't or can't be measured and might influence the outcomes

* regression analysis can help determine if there are relationships between the variable, and later calculations help remove it's influence from the equations

## From Theory to Variable and Back Again
Theories:
* suggest
* predict relations
* predict impact
* lead to revisions

# Key Elements of Hypothese
* predictions about the relationships among variables
* based on prior research
* a testable statement

```
In our paper - identify the hypotheses and judge them.
```

# Review of Statistical Analysis
* descriptive (univariate analysis)
* associational (bivariate and multivariate)
* Inferential - for making estimates about populations and for **significance and hypothesis testing**

**If your study is about associational variables, there won't probably be a hypothesis in the introduction.**

```
Correlations are interesting, but not as interesting as **predictors**.
```

# Different Types of Designs
* Experimental
* Quasi-experimental
* Non-experimental

(table activity)

---
**Experimental:** identifies variables and takes measurements, **random sampling**, double-blind, determine correlations
ie. Strict greenhouse lab environment, no rain, dew, shade factors; precise amount of water controlled

**Quasi-experimental:** **pre-existing groups**; relies on research, don't do random sampling, they assign subjects to treatment groups; at least one IV is not manipulated; moderate causal inferences
ie. Measure growth of a plant based on water intake; use the same plant; not the same level of control

**Non-experimental:** **Observation**; IV not manipulated; not assigned to conditions; weak weak causal inferences
ie. Observing children in a school yard to report on behaviour; 
ie. measuring plant growth and checking weather history

Caffiene effects student results on test. Has a control and a treatment group.
Experimental: Random sampling

Quasi-experimental: **pre-existing groups**, classrooms, not controlling how often, how much, researcher does not decide, still looking at grades
Non-experimental: observing without knowing who had coffee

Pregnancy: Effects of smoking on birthweight
Experiment: Random sampling; Pack of smokes per day
Quasi-experimental: Just find smokers and non-smokers; could be confounding variables; more associated variables; 
Non-experimental: observe, ask questions

```
In our papers, identify the type of design.
```

**At the start of an experiment, it is important to establish that the control group and experimental groups have similar baselines, ie., pre-test reading ability of different groups before the experiment. Similar age, similar SES etc.**

Ethical sent or volunteers will always affect the validity of results.

* Do any or all of your studies involve random assignment of subjects?
* Do any or all of your studies involve a control group?

## The Independent Variable
Best: researcher controls it
* Did anyone have a study in which the researcher had control over the IV?
* Did anyone have a study in which the researcher had limited control over the IV?


# The Null Hypothesis - H<sub>o</sub>
Use of a log sheet has no result on reading results.
The hypothesis of no result.

**The Alternative Hypothesis - H<sub>1</sub>**
* may be directional or non-directional
** **non=directional**: control group and experimental group are different but say nothing about how
** **directional**: state how the groups will be different
* Always determine prior to data collection

See chart for Decision making regarding the Null Hypothesis.
